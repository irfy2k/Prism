# **App Name**: Local Life

## Core Features:

- Tasks Module: Allow users to create, manage, and track tasks with due dates and priority levels, using local storage to persist data.
- Habits Module: Enable users to define and track daily/weekly habits, recording progress and streaks. Data is stored locally.
- Finance Module: Implement a basic financial tracking tool where users can input income and expenses to get insights on where their money is going, stored locally.
- Central Dashboard: Create a central dashboard displaying summaries of tasks, habits, and finances, providing a quick overview of the user's day. Generate personalized advice based on the data using a generative AI tool. Note: the quality of the advice may be poor during this initial MVP phase. Do not offer any investment or medical advice.
- Offline Mode: Provide offline availability: Data is stored locally for all the modules

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to create a sense of trust, reliability, and calm, reflecting the nature of personal data and long-term habits. This is not Teal. Deep Blue feels solid, honest and dependable. We avoided cliche 'energetic' colors, or calming greens.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E8EAF6) as a neutral backdrop that allows the primary color to stand out without overwhelming the user. This tone avoids pure white for reduced eye strain.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#7E57C2), to bring sophistication without distracting from the central content. The accent is a color for charts, action buttons, or highlighs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons throughout the app. These are easier on the eyes when the number of displayed datapoints becomes very high.
- Use a tab-based navigation for switching between modules. Cards for presenting data summaries.
- Subtle animations when data is loaded or updated. To reduce distraction, the number of animated UI elements should be minimized.
